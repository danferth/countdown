# What Is Countdown?

Countdown is a Jamstack website crafted with React using the Next.js framework.
The site's core feature is to provide a countdown to a specific date and time.
By default, it counts down to the next Friday at 5:00 PM in your local timezone.
You can customize the countdown to repeat weekly, monthly, yearly, or set a
one-time countdown.

> efficiently demonstrates my capabilities in one comprehensive project.

## Why Build It?

Throughout my career, many of the impressive projects I've built either use
older tech stacks like `PHP/MySQL/Apache` or are for internal use, making them
inaccessible. I created Countdown to showcase my skills using the modern stack
of `React/Next.js`, aligning with current job market I'd like to work in.

## What Capabilities Am I Showing?

- **API Requests:** Integrating external APIs, like fetching Kanye quotes.
- **Functionality:** Implementing a real-time countdown timer.
- **Global State Management:** Managing the countdown target date/time across
  the app.
- **Form Handling:** Allowing users to update the global state via forms.
- **Design:** Crafting a visually appealing interface beyond basic Bootstrap.
- **Open Source Contribution:** Maintaining a publicly accessible repository not
  tied to proprietary work.
- **Deployment:** Hosting the project for interactive use and demonstration.
